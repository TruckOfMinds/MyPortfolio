# What is this

Hall of Fame is an active record of my Pokémon playthrough teams that reach the final step/defeat the champion. This serves as a way to document and preserve information about each of my teams, as well as a utility for measuring which pokemon I use the most, and which ones I don't use enough!
It was created by me to document my Pokémon team victories in an external, preserved way with a bespoke search function. This features the use of query functions, conditional formatting, and an API call to `PokeAPI`.

# What's Here

Each team contains 6 members, each having important metadata for that specific pokémon: their nickname, final list of 4 moves, nature, ability, held item, image showing their most _unique_ form and more extra bits.
Hall of Fame also features a _Totals_ page that tracks how many times a specific pokémon form appears in the team bank. it uses a google sheets table to allow for filtering and sorting of items, as well as clearly showing images of the pokémon and separates each numeric value.

# How to Use it

To use the search feature, you must enter the specific `id` for that team entry; therefore you must know the specific information each character in the id represents in order to apply it:
An example id `762002N` can be split up into 5 sections:

| Section | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    7    | The number of the Pokémon **region** the game takes place in, in chronological order. _`i.e. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Orre, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, Paldea`_ . If the number exceeds past 9, then hexadecimal syntax will be used, `e.g. 10 = A`. If the game is fan-made (rom hack, Pokérogue, etc.) and does NOT take place in an official reigon listed above, then a **percent** (%) will be used instead. **_This examples indicates we are in the Kalos region._** |
|    6    | The number of the Pokémon **generation** the game was released, in chronological order. **_This example indicates we are in Generation 6._**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|    2    | The **index** of the game in the list of games with the **same reigon and generation** values _— See chart below for the full reference_. If the game is fan-made (rom hack, Pokérogue, etc.) and is in an official reigion (i.e. no `%` are present) then and `R` will be appended to distinguish from official games. **_This example indicates we are in Pokémon Y._**                                                                                                        |
|   002   | The index of the **playthrough** for that specific game, in chronological order. **_This example indicates it is the 2nd playthrough._**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|    N    | OPTIONAL — Present if the playthrough is a Nuzlocke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
